"You address the robot in front of you. Their label reads '0-376'."
[0-86] "I found this tape recorder... It talks about the world above."
"0-376's optics dim momentarily. After a short while, they turn away."
[0-376] "Burn it. It's noise. Nothing changes."

Persist:
[0-86] "The voice-"
[0-376] "Are you still on about that? I said forget it."
[0-376] "Surface stuff? Not for us. Never meant for us."
"Their voice is quiet, almost distant, but there's something guarded in the way they speak."

Fetch:
"0-376's frame stops, their posture stiffening. A low hum vibrates from deep within their systems."
"0-376 does not dismiss you but pivots, tone mechanical."
[0-376] "There's work. Forget the tape."
"They face the room across the chamber, where the beeping of a small terminal can be heard."
[0-376] "I can give you access to that room. Some processing needs to be done in there."
"The decrepit automaton hands you a keycard with a strange logo on it."
[0-376] "It should be pretty straightforward. I'd do it myself, but I need to watch over these computers."
[0-376] "Once you're done, come back here to show me your task log."
"With that, the droid falls silent, their programming directing their attention elsewhere."
