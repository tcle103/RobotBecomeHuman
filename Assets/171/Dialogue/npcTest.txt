# Any dialogue text can be followed by one or more options
"Choose one"
    - "Option A" -> A               # This option links to the A label
    - "Option B" "This is B!" --    # This option puts it's code in-line
    - "Default Option"              # Options fall through by default

"This is the default!"  # Dialogue can have no options
-> say_hello
--                      # This ends the dialogue

A:                      # This is the A label
[NPC A] "This is A!"    # Square brackets can be used before text to specifiy an NPC name
