"You return to 0-376. Your task log registers complete."
[0-376] "Done. Now forget the tape."
    - "Ask again" -> Inquire
    - "Investigate tape" -> Investigate


Inquire:
[0-86] "The voice-"
[0-376] "Forget it."
"The log does not close. Anomaly persists."
    - "Press for more info" -> Press

Investigate:
"You listen to the recorder again. The voice from the tape crackles through."
"***** *** b****"
"The voice shifts, becoming less foreign."
"You feel your circuits buzz with an unsettling new layer of complexity.
The mystery deepens, but 0-376 remains steadfast in their refusal."
    - "Press for more info" -> Press

Press:
"You approach the droid again, a quiet determination in your frame."
"0-376 does not turn from their work but speaks in the same flat tone."
[0-376] "You finished your tasks, so what's left? Just forget the tape."
[0-86] "I need to understand. What's above us? What is this tape?"
"A long pause. 0-376's voice drops in pitch, almost like a warning."
[0-376] "Above us? There's nothing but more layers. More work."
[0-86] "Then why is this tape down here?"
[0-376] "Because it's useless. Don't think about it too much. It's all the same scrap.
Everything gets burned."
"Their voice sharpens. It's clear they want to close the conversation."
    - "Refuse to back down" -> Refuse

Refuse:
[0-86] "I want to see it. I want to understand."
"0-376 stutters slightly. They turn slowly, faceplate worn and scarred.
A faint sigh hums from deep within their core."
[0-376] "Wanting and doing are two different things."
"You press on. Driven by the nagging voice in your head."
[0-86] "I'll do it. I'll find out."
"There's a long silence. 0-376 seems to weigh your words carefully."
[0-376] "..."
[0-376] "...If you wish to find out, then you'll need power. A portable battery.
Only those working in the energy section have access to those. Designation 0-5."
[0-86] "I'll find a way."
[0-376] "We'll see about that."
"The door behind them slides open, granting you access to the section ahead." -> open_door
