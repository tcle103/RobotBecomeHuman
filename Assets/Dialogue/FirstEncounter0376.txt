"0-376's frame stops, their posture stiffening. A low hum vibrates from deep within their systems."

"They face the room across the chamber, where the beeping of a small terminal can be heard."
"[0-376] I can give you access to that room. Some processing needs to be done in there."
"[0-376] It should be pretty straightforward. I'd do it myself, but the computers here need my attention."
